"""IMX519 / Jetson continuous autofocus (turbo-only, no fine scan).

Run beside JetsonCamera.py and Focuser.py. Fixed central ROI, not object
tracking. Motion gating is a heuristic, not a motion/defocus classifier.

Trigger: the smoothed ROI score drops below reference x drop-ratio, or rises
above reference x rise-ratio (new / more textured target). In NO TARGET
(reference < min-sharpness) only a rise to min-sharpness or to
reference x NO_TARGET_RISE triggers. A rise-triggered scan that finds no
clearly better side accepts the (interpolated) current position as focused
instead of failing, so the lens does not wobble on lighting changes.

Turbo search:  PROBE (origin score reused from MONITOR, measure +/-STEP)
-> WALK toward the better side until the score stops improving -> interpolate
the peak from the best point and its two measured neighbours (no extra moves)
-> VERIFY.

If PROBE sees only blur (all scores < min-sharpness: lens far from focus, or a
blank scene), one coarse RESCUE sweep per trigger finds the region, then a
LOCAL +/-STEP probe hands over to WALK/interpolation. A RESCUE that finds no
texture puts the controller straight into NO TARGET (reference = current
score) so it waits for a new target instead of retrying.

Exposure: gradient energy grows with brightness squared, so an auto-exposure
step looks like a focus change. Scores are compared at the ROI brightness of
the last search start (score x (base / brightness)^2); the reference is
rescaled whenever that base changes. The score itself is unchanged (no fixed
normalisation, which would amplify noise in dark scenes), so --min-sharpness
keeps its meaning. --no-exposure-comp disables this.

Timing: after each lens move, sample once --settle has passed AND
--guard-frames frames (still in the camera pipeline) have been dropped; the
two waits overlap, as max(settle, guard frames). Motion / bad exposure lasting
HOLD_ABORT during a search aborts it and restores the previous position.
--calibrate measures score noise and pipeline latency and prints values for
--guard-frames and --walk-gain.
